Import Vector Machine classifier


The Import Vector Machines (Zhu and Hastie 2005) are a sparse, discriminative and probabilistic classifier.

The algorithm is based on the Kernel Logistic Regression model, but uses only a few data points to define the decision hyperplane in the feature space. These data points are called import vectors.

The Import Vector Machine shows similar results to the widely used Support Vector Machine, but has a probabilistic output.

The Import Vector Machine is described in this Journal article, on which our implementation is based on:

Ji Zhu and Trevor Hastie, “Kernel Logistic Regression and the Import Vector Machine“, Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics, 2005, Vol. 14(1), pp. 185-205.(download)

Our Import Vector Machine algorithm can be found in:
